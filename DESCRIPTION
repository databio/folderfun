Title: Creates and Manages Folder Functions for Portable Large-Scale R Analysis
Description: If you find yourself working on multiple different projects in R, you'll want a 
	series of folders pointing to raw data, processed data, plot results, intermediate table 
	outputs, etc. This package makes it easier to do that by providing a quick and easy way 
	to create and use functions for project-level directories.
