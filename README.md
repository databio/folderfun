# `folderfun`: Managing R disk resources with folder functions 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/databio/folderfun.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/databio/folderfun)

If you find yourself working on multiple different projects in R, you'll want a series of folders pointing to raw data, processed data, plot results, intermediate table outputs, etc. This package makes it easier to do that by providing a quick and easy way to create and use functions for any directories, so you don't have to deal with annoying hard-coded absolute paths.

Go from this:

```{r}
d = read.table("/long/and/annoying/path/to/hard/coded/file/data.txt")
```

to this:

```{r}
d = read.table(ffIn("data.txt"))
```

## Installing

```{r}
devtools::install_github("databio/folderfun")
```

## Quick start
